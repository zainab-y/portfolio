<h3>Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words)</h3>

Domains are a distinct subdivision of the Internet consisting of computers or sites usually with a common purpose (such as providing commercial information) and represented by a unique abbreviation in Internet addresses by a such as .edu(educational institutions), .gov(government websites), .com(commercial websites), .org etc.

Web servers are programs that use HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to serve the files that form Web pages to users.

Domain Name Servers (DNS) are the Internet's equivalent of a phone book. They maintain a directory of domain names and translate them to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.
When you type in a web address, e.g. www.reddit.com, your Internet Service Provider sees the DNS associated with the domain name, translates it into a machine friendly IP address (for example 216.168.224.70 is the IP for jimsbikes.com) and directs your Internet connection to the correct website. 

A web browser is a software application for accessing information on the Web. Different URLs are attributed to each web page, image and video on the internet. This enables the browser to retrieve and display them on their device.

<h3>Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words)</h3>
Facebook has changed the way we share our lives, communicate and consume content on the internet. Facebook became an important tool to keeping in touch with people across the world and with old friends. Facebook collected more than 1 billion users and because of the vastness of the people using it, it was able to be successful because of this. 

We can now share other aspects of our lives such as our photos, our thoughts, what movies and music we like and it has become less personal.

Facebook users consume content that is seen on the social site, this includes politics, sport and cool memes.
